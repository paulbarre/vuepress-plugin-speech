**$speech.speak(`text`)**: Synthesis a text by the current voice

## `tts` component

This plugin installs a component you can add into your Markdown files to show texts _playable_.

```md

Some paragraph with a text that can be synthesize: <tts text="Hello folks!" />
```

`tts` has two props:

**`text`**: The text to show and speak if `alt` is undefined.

**`alt`**: The true text to speak. It allows you to show some text but read another.

```md
<tts text="Hello" alt="Goodbye" />
```
